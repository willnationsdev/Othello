# Othello
A simple Othello game I made in my second CompSci class at Baylor (team project)

Simple interface. Black goes first, then White, alternating back and forth.

It would appear that this version is an older one, however, as it isn't updating appropriately. The AI seems to
be missing from it as well. Will need to pursue one of the other teammates to see if I can acquire a working copy.
